   note:

    1. The current version does not complain about duplicate keys in the symbol table.
       This should be changed in the near future (as part of error handling).
       
    2. Conflicts: 1 shift/reduce, 1 reduce/reduce

    3. The current symbol table does not have any name-mangling features (to be added
       in the foreseeable future).
