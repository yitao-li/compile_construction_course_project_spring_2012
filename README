/*

   note:

    1. Conflicts: 1 shift/reduce, 1 reduce/reduce

    2. The current symbol table does not have any name-mangling features (to be added
       in the foreseeable future).

    3. The current version only checks for type mismatch in simple assignment operations (i.e. assignment in the form of "a := b") but does not check for
       type mismatch in assignment of the form "a := b + c" (since specific language-dependent rules are needed to determine the type of the right-hand side
       and the project would become too complicated if all those rules have to be included).
